Health care is one of the domains where computer vision and object detection have played
important role in recent years. Computer vision can be utilized in health care to automate and aid
in the diagnosis and analysis of some medical imagery. One example of this application is the
detection of Pneumonia in the chest X-Ray, other applications of computer vision are in MRI
(Magnetic Resonance Imaging) where computer vision models help doctors to automate the
segmentation/localization of region of interest in the image.
